# Overview:
This project is in two parts: 
- The first part involves performing a multiple linear regression analysis using R on a dataset. The dataset contains information about individuals' annual earnings and various predictor variables like education, gender, age, and more. The main objectives of this project are to create a regression model, test for multicollinearity, perform diagnostics on the model, and compare it with a robust regression model.
- The second partproject focuses on predicting credit default using logistic regression analysis. It uses a dataset containing information about individuals, including their age, debt ratio, yearly income, late payment history, and whether they have defaulted on their credit. The goal is to build a predictive model that can help identify individuals who are likely to default on their credit.
